+ ## [[Transforming Reference Frames]]
	+ ### Example: transform point A at (4,5) in a plane shifted two units in the y direction and two units in the x direction, as well as 45 degrees tilted from the x axis to the main reference frame (world coordinate)
	+ answer: $$A' =(9/\sqrt2, 3/\sqrt2) $$
+ ## Order of transformations
	+ missed this, ask prof after class
+ ## 2-Dimensional Viewing
	+ Which way you are facing the object changes the viewing angle, giving you different perceptions of the size and shape of the image
+ ### Terminology
	+ [[Clipping Window]]/world window/viewing window - section of a 2-D scene that we want to display on the monitor (ideally in the [[Viewport]])
+ ## Two-Dimensional Viewing Pipeline
	+ [[Viewport]] decides what we are going to see on a given device
	+ Model coordinates -> World Coordinates -> Viewing Coordinates -> Normalized Coordinates -> Device Coordinates
	1. Construct World Coordinate Scene Using Modeling-Coordinate Transformations
