+ [[Normalization]] is when we change the x and y coordinates to be normalized between 0 and 1
+ [[Viewport]] converts 3D to 2D
+ If I convert a world coordinate to a normalized viewport, what would it look like?
	+ we have a point in our world coordinate $$(x_w,y_w)$$
	+ x coordinates in the clipping window for the world coordinates are in the range $$(x_{wmin},y_{wmin})$$ to $$(x_{wmax},y_{wmax})$$
	+ x coordinates in the clipping window for the normalized coordinates are in the range $$(x_{vmin},y_{vmin})$$ to $$(x_{vmax},y_{vmax})$$Formula for normalization: $$x_{new}=(x-x_{min}/(x_{max}-x_{min}))$$
